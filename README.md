# GeoD

We present GeoD, a consensus-based distributed SE(3) pose graph optimization algorithm with provable convergence guarantees. This algorithm enables a group of robots, given noisy relative pose measurements, to reach agreement on the groupâ€™s SE(3) pose history in a distributed manner. 

This repository contains a basic MATLAB implementation of GeoD. We provide several simulated pose graphs and the multi-UAV dataset from our recent paper [1]. We provide the option to directly compare GeoD to Se-Sync if desired. Installing SE-Sync allows you to run GeoD on standard SLAM datasets as well. 


## Dependencies

### SE-Sync
We compare GeoD to [SE-Sync](https://github.com/david-m-rosen/SE-Sync) in our paper. SE-Sync is a centralized, certifiable pose graph optimization method that optimizes the chordal distance on rotation instead of the geodesic distance as GeoD does. 

If you would like to compare to SE-Sync or use the standard SLAM datasets, download and install SE-Sync. You will have to set the path to your local SE-Sync in main.m. 


## Getting Started

Run the main.m script to start using GeoD.
